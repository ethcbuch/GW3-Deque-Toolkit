# GW3-Deque-Toolkit
ERROR 404 - Hunter Johnson and Ethan Buchanan

____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

The Program:
This program creates a Deque backed by a 2D Dynamic array. It has functions to pop and push to both the front and back of the Deque allowing the user to
add and remove information from deque quite easily. It also has accessors for returning the front and back of the deque. There is also functions that return
the number of elements aswell as the return whether the deque is empty or not. To find elements at an index call the obeject create in main as deque[].
____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

Running the Program:
To run the program simply run the makefile to create an executable then run the executable ./movielibrary, Main already has many test cases which show the
functionality of the program. You can also read from a file and push it contents to a deque. The file should be formatted as such:
-1 /n
-2 /n
-3 /n
-4 /n
-5 /n
-. /n
-. /n
-. /n
-n

Challenges:
The challenges on this one was actually figuring out how to start coding the program and getting the push_back first created. Once we got the fundamentals
of the deque down, the latter functions became less difficult just time consuming in implementation. We got all the functions done before the deadline but
we needed some extra time to give main some love and finished everything up.

Sharing the Work:
We continued like we had been doing the last two group assingments where Hunter was the driver doing alot of the coding while Ethan would be trying to keep
everything in order. Hunter implemented the push/pop functions and the print function and Ethan went back and debugged them. Ethan did documentation and
created the README while Hunter went and redid the testing for main.
